Additionally, their formulation\\nallows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without\\nretraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel\\nspace, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and\\ninference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on\\nlimited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility,\\nwe apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In\\ncontrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation\\nallows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity\\nreduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By\\nintroducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn\\ndiffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning\\ninputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes\\npossible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve\\na new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance\\non various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene\\nsynthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational\\nrequirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion .</td>\n",

Neural networks are not, in general,\\ncapable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is\\nan inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to\\novercome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on\\ntasks which they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers\\nold tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for\\nthose tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a\\nset of classification tasks based on the MNIST hand written digit dataset and\\nby learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.</td>\n",

We show that, for models trained from scratch as well as\\npretrained ones, using a variant of the triplet loss to perform end-to-end deep\\nmetric learning outperforms most other published methods by a large margin.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2011),\\na benchmark for commonsense reasoning, is a set of 273 expert-crafted pronoun\\nresolution problems originally designed to be unsolvable for statistical models\\nthat rely on selectional preferences or word associations. However, recent\\nadvances in neural language models have already reached around 90% accuracy on\\nvariants of WSC. This raises an important question whether these models have\\ntruly acquired robust commonsense capabilities or whether they rely on spurious\\nbiases in the datasets that lead to an overestimation of the true capabilities\\nof machine commonsense. To investigate this question, we introduce WinoGrande,\\na large-scale dataset of 44k problems, inspired by the original WSC design, but\\nadjusted to improve both the scale and the hardness of the dataset. The key\\nsteps of the dataset construction consist of (1) a carefully designed\\ncrowdsourcing procedure, followed by (2) systematic bias reduction using a\\nnovel AfLite algorithm that generalizes human-detectable word associations to\\nmachine-detectable embedding associations. The best state-of-the-art methods on\\nWinoGrande achieve 59.4-79.1%, which are 15-35% below human performance of\\n94.0%, depending on the amount of the training data allowed. Furthermore, we\\nestablish new state-of-the-art results on five related benchmarks - WSC\\n(90.1%), DPR (93.1%), COPA (90.6%), KnowRef (85.6%), and Winogender (97.1%).\\nThese results have dual implications: on one hand, they demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of WinoGrande when used as a resource for transfer learning. On\\nthe other hand, they raise a concern that we are likely to be overestimating\\nthe true capabilities of machine commonsense across all these benchmarks. We\\nemphasize the importance of algorithmic bias reduction in existing and future\\nbenchmarks to mitigate such overestimation.</td>\n",

This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair\\nfrom 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while\\nmaintaining the accuracy from BERT.\\n  We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning\\ntasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.</td>\n",

In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a\\nsmaller general-purpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which\\ncan then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its\\nlarger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation\\nfor building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during\\nthe pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a\\nBERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding\\ncapabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by\\nlarger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining\\nlanguage modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster\\nand lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities\\nfor on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative\\non-device study.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising\\nfunction, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a\\nstandard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which,\\ndespite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the\\nbidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and many other\\nmore recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches,\\nfinding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of the\\noriginal sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are\\nreplaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine\\ntuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It\\nmatches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE\\nand SQuAD, achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive\\ndialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 6\\nROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system\\nfor machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also report\\nablation experiments that replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART\\nframework, to better measure which factors most influence end-task performance.</td>\n",

We show that averaging the weights of multiple\\nmodels fine-tuned with different hyperparameter configurations often improves\\naccuracy and robustness. Unlike a conventional ensemble, we may average many\\nmodels without incurring any additional inference or memory costs -- we call\\nthe results \"model soups.\" When fine-tuning large pre-trained models such as\\nCLIP, ALIGN, and a ViT-G pre-trained on JFT, our soup recipe provides\\nsignificant improvements over the best model in a hyperparameter sweep on\\nImageNet. The resulting ViT-G model, which attains 90.94% top-1 accuracy on\\nImageNet, achieved a new state of the art. Furthermore, we show that the model\\nsoup approach extends to multiple image classification and natural language\\nprocessing tasks, improves out-of-distribution performance, and improves\\nzero-shot performance on new downstream tasks. Finally, we analytically relate\\nthe performance similarity of weight-averaging and logit-ensembling to flatness\\nof the loss and confidence of the predictions, and validate this relation\\nempirically.

Yet, few works investigated the impact on performance when\\nthe data properties substantially differ between the pre-training and\\nfine-tuning phases, termed domain shift. We target this scenario by analyzing\\nthe robustness of Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLS-R models on downstream ASR for a\\ncompletely unseen domain, air traffic control (ATC) communications. We\\nbenchmark these two models on several open-source and challenging ATC databases\\nwith signal-to-noise ratio between 5 and 20 dB. Relative word error rate (WER)\\nreductions between 20% to 40% are obtained in comparison to hybrid-based ASR\\nbaselines by only fine-tuning E2E acoustic models with a smaller fraction of\\nlabeled data.

When training such representations, it is\\noften the case that computational and statistical constraints for each\\ndownstream task are unknown. In this context rigid, fixed capacity\\nrepresentations can be either over or under-accommodating to the task at hand.\\nThis leads us to ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to\\nmultiple downstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main\\ncontribution is Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) which encodes\\ninformation at different granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt\\nto the computational constraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies\\nexisting representation learning pipelines and imposes no additional cost\\nduring inference and deployment. MRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that\\nare at least as accurate and rich as independently trained low-dimensional\\nrepresentations. The flexibility within the learned Matryoshka Representations\\noffer: (a) up to 14x smaller embedding size for ImageNet-1K classification at\\nthe same level of accuracy; (b) up to 14x real-world speed-ups for large-scale\\nretrieval on ImageNet-1K and 4K; and (c) up to 2% accuracy improvements for\\nlong-tail few-shot classification, all while being as robust as the original\\nrepresentations. Finally, we show that MRL extends seamlessly to web-scale\\ndatasets (ImageNet, JFT) across various modalities -- vision (ViT, ResNet),\\nvision + language (ALIGN) and language (BERT).

       "      <td>Expanding Language-Image Pretrained Models for General Video Recognition</td>\n",
       "      <td>Contrastive language-image pretraining has shown great success in learning\\nvisual-textual joint representation from web-scale data, demonstrating\\nremarkable \"zero-shot\" generalization ability for various image tasks. However,\\nhow to effectively expand such new language-image pretraining methods to video\\ndomains is still an open problem. In this work, we present a simple yet\\neffective approach that adapts the pretrained language-image models to video\\nrecognition directly, instead of pretraining a new model from scratch. More\\nconcretely, to capture the long-range dependencies of frames along the temporal\\ndimension, we propose a cross-frame attention mechanism that explicitly\\nexchanges information across frames. Such module is lightweight and can be\\nplugged into pretrained language-image models seamlessly. Moreover, we propose\\na video-specific prompting scheme, which leverages video content information\\nfor generating discriminative textual prompts. Extensive experiments\\ndemonstrate that our approach is effective and can be generalized to different\\nvideo recognition scenarios. In particular, under fully-supervised settings,\\nour approach achieves a top-1 accuracy of 87.1% on Kinectics-400, while using\\n12 times fewer FLOPs compared with Swin-L and ViViT-H. In zero-shot\\nexperiments, our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods by\\n+7.6% and +14.9% in terms of top-1 accuracy under two popular protocols. In\\nfew-shot scenarios, our approach outperforms previous best methods by +32.1%\\nand +23.1% when the labeled data is extremely limited. Code and models are\\navailable at https://aka.ms/X-CLIP</td>\n",

       "      <td>Recent few-shot methods, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and\\npattern exploiting training (PET), have achieved impressive results in\\nlabel-scarce settings. However, they are difficult to employ since they are\\nsubject to high variability from manually crafted prompts, and typically\\nrequire billion-parameter language models to achieve high accuracy. To address\\nthese shortcomings, we propose SetFit (Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning), an\\nefficient and prompt-free framework for few-shot fine-tuning of Sentence\\nTransformers (ST). SetFit works by first fine-tuning a pretrained ST on a small\\nnumber of text pairs, in a contrastive Siamese manner. The resulting model is\\nthen used to generate rich text embeddings, which are used to train a\\nclassification head. This simple framework requires no prompts or verbalizers,\\nand achieves high accuracy with orders of magnitude less parameters than\\nexisting techniques. Our experiments show that SetFit obtains comparable\\nresults with PEFT and PET techniques, while being an order of magnitude faster\\nto train. We also show that SetFit can be applied in multilingual settings by\\nsimply switching the ST body. Our code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/huggingface/setfit and our datasets at\\nhttps://huggingface.co/setfit .</td>\n",

We present a new pre-training strategy named ccc-wav2vec 2.0, which\\nuses clustering and an augmentation-based cross-contrastive loss as its\\nself-supervised objective. Through the clustering module, we scale down the\\ninfluence of those negative examples that are highly similar to the positive.\\nThe Cross-Contrastive loss is computed between the encoder output of the\\noriginal sample and the quantizer output of its augmentation and vice-versa,\\nbringing robustness to the pre-training strategy. ccc-wav2vec 2.0 achieves up\\nto 15.6% and 12.7% relative WER improvement over the baseline wav2vec 2.0 on\\nthe test-clean and test-other sets, respectively, of LibriSpeech, without the\\nuse of any language model. The proposed method also achieves up to 14.9%\\nrelative WER improvement over the baseline wav2vec 2.0 when fine-tuned on\\nSwitchboard data.

       "      <td>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities\\nacross tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their\\nabilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g.\\naction plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this\\npaper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and\\ntask-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy\\nbetween the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update\\naction plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface\\nwith external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather\\nadditional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of\\nlanguage and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over\\nstate-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and\\ntrustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components.\\nConcretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever),\\nReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in\\nchain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and\\ngenerates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than\\nbaselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making\\nbenchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and\\nreinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10%\\nrespectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.\\nProject site with code: https://react-lm.github.io</td>\n",

       "      <td>Powerful generative models have led to recent progress in question generation\\n(QG). However, it is difficult to measure advances in QG research since there\\nare no standardized resources that allow a uniform comparison among approaches.\\nIn this paper, we introduce QG-Bench, a multilingual and multidomain benchmark\\nfor QG that unifies existing question answering datasets by converting them to\\na standard QG setting. It includes general-purpose datasets such as SQuAD for\\nEnglish, datasets from ten domains and two styles, as well as datasets in eight\\ndifferent languages. Using QG-Bench as a reference, we perform an extensive\\nanalysis of the capabilities of language models for the task. First, we propose\\nrobust QG baselines based on fine-tuning generative language models. Then, we\\ncomplement automatic evaluation based on standard metrics with an extensive\\nmanual evaluation, which in turn sheds light on the difficulty of evaluating QG\\nmodels. Finally, we analyse both the domain adaptability of these models as\\nwell as the effectiveness of multilingual models in languages other than\\nEnglish. QG-Bench is released along with the fine-tuned models presented in the\\npaper https://github.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation, which are also\\navailable as a demo https://autoqg.net/.</td>\n",

It is\\nunclear whether state-of-the-art embeddings on semantic textual similarity\\n(STS) can be equally well applied to other tasks like clustering or reranking.\\nThis makes progress in the field difficult to track, as various models are\\nconstantly being proposed without proper evaluation. To solve this problem, we\\nintroduce the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). MTEB spans 8 embedding\\ntasks covering a total of 58 datasets and 112 languages. Through the\\nbenchmarking of 33 models on MTEB, we establish the most comprehensive\\nbenchmark of text embeddings to date. We find that no particular text embedding\\nmethod dominates across all tasks. This suggests that the field has yet to\\nconverge on a universal text embedding method and scale it up sufficiently to\\nprovide state-of-the-art results on all embedding tasks.

In our paradigm, language models (transformers and an\\nLSTM) processed English text in which a list of nouns occurred twice. We\\noperationalized retrieval as the reduction in surprisal from the first to the\\nsecond list. We found that the transformers retrieved both the identity and\\nordering of nouns from the first list. Further, the transformers' retrieval was\\nmarkedly enhanced when they were trained on a larger corpus and with greater\\nmodel depth. Lastly, their ability to index prior tokens was dependent on\\nlearned attention patterns. In contrast, the LSTM exhibited less precise\\nretrieval, which was limited to list-initial tokens and to short intervening\\ntexts. The LSTM's retrieval was not sensitive to the order of nouns and it\\nimproved when the list was semantically coherent. We conclude that transformers\\nimplemented something akin to a working memory system that could flexibly\\nretrieve individual token representations across arbitrary delays; conversely,\\nthe LSTM maintained a coarser and more rapidly-decaying semantic gist of prior\\ntokens, weighted toward the earliest items.</td>\n",

The algorithm is fed with frame-wise character\\nposteriors produced by a seed ASR, trained with out-of-domain data, and\\noptimized throughout a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss.

Specifically, GPTQ can quantize GPT\\nmodels with 175 billion parameters in approximately four GPU hours, reducing\\nthe bitwidth down to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible accuracy\\ndegradation relative to the uncompressed baseline. Our method more than doubles\\nthe compression gains relative to previously-proposed one-shot quantization\\nmethods, preserving accuracy, allowing us for the first time to execute an 175\\nbillion-parameter model inside a single GPU for generative inference. Moreover,\\nwe also show that our method can still provide reasonable accuracy in the\\nextreme quantization regime, in which weights are quantized to 2-bit or even\\nternary quantization levels.

These\\nadvantages have led to a proliferation of task-specific fine-tuned models,\\nwhich typically can only perform a single task and do not benefit from one\\nanother. Recently, model merging techniques have emerged as a solution to\\ncombine multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model without\\nperforming additional training. However, existing merging methods often ignore\\nthe interference between parameters of different models, resulting in large\\nperformance drops when merging multiple models. In this paper, we demonstrate\\nthat prior merging techniques inadvertently lose valuable information due to\\ntwo major sources of interference: (a) interference due to redundant parameter\\nvalues and (b) disagreement on the sign of a given parameter's values across\\nmodels. To address this, we propose our method, TrIm, Elect Sign &amp; Merge\\n(TIES-Merging), which introduces three novel steps when merging models: (1)\\nresetting parameters that only changed a small amount during fine-tuning, (2)\\nresolving sign conflicts, and (3) merging only the parameters that are in\\nalignment with the final agreed-upon sign.

Recent\\ndevelopments have incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\\nlearning fine-tuning (RLFT) to align these models with human goals. However,\\nSFT methods treat all training data with mixed quality equally, while RLFT\\nmethods require high-quality pairwise or ranking-based preference data. In this\\nstudy, we present a novel framework, named OpenChat, to advance open-source\\nlanguage models with mixed-quality data. Specifically, we consider the general\\nSFT training data, consisting of a small amount of expert data mixed with a\\nlarge proportion of sub-optimal data, without any preference labels. We propose\\nthe C(onditioned)-RLFT, which regards different data sources as coarse-grained\\nreward labels and learns a class-conditioned policy to leverage complementary\\ndata quality information.

Through extensive\\nexperiments on three standard benchmarks, our openchat-13b fine-tuned with\\nC-RLFT achieves the highest average performance among all 13b open-source\\nlanguage models. Moreover, we use AGIEval to validate the model generalization\\nperformance, in which only openchat-13b surpasses the base model.

       "      <td>In this paper, we uncover that Language Models (LMs), either encoder- or\\ndecoder-based, can obtain new capabilities by assimilating the parameters of\\nhomologous models without retraining or GPUs. Typically, new abilities of LMs\\ncan be imparted by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), reflected in the disparity\\nbetween fine-tuned and pre-trained parameters (i.e., delta parameters). We\\ninitially observe that by introducing a novel operation called DARE (Drop And\\nREscale), most delta parameters can be directly set to zeros without affecting\\nthe capabilities of SFT LMs and larger models can tolerate a higher proportion\\nof discarded parameters. Based on this observation, we further sparsify delta\\nparameters of multiple SFT homologous models with DARE and subsequently merge\\nthem into a single model by parameter averaging. We conduct experiments on\\neight datasets from the GLUE benchmark with BERT and RoBERTa. We also merge\\nWizardLM, WizardMath, and Code Alpaca based on Llama 2. Experimental results\\nshow that: (1) The delta parameter value ranges for SFT models are typically\\nsmall, often within 0.005, and DARE can eliminate 99% of them effortlessly.\\nHowever, once the models are continuously pre-trained, the value ranges can\\ngrow to around 0.03, making DARE impractical. We have also tried to remove\\nfine-tuned instead of delta parameters and find that a 10% reduction can lead\\nto drastically decreased performance (even to 0). This highlights that SFT\\nmerely stimulates the abilities via delta parameters rather than injecting new\\nabilities into LMs; (2) DARE can merge multiple task-specific LMs into one LM\\nwith diverse abilities.

Yet, the community is only slowly\\nadopting these models for text embedding tasks, which require rich\\ncontextualized representations. In this work, we introduce LLM2Vec, a simple\\nunsupervised approach that can transform any decoder-only LLM into a strong\\ntext encoder. LLM2Vec consists of three simple steps: 1) enabling bidirectional\\nattention, 2) masked next token prediction, and 3) unsupervised contrastive\\nlearning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM2Vec by applying it to 3\\npopular LLMs ranging from 1.3B to 7B parameters and evaluate the transformed\\nmodels on English word- and sequence-level tasks. We outperform encoder-only\\nmodels by a large margin on word-level tasks and reach a new unsupervised\\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB).\\nMoreover, when combining LLM2Vec with supervised contrastive learning, we\\nachieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB among models that train only on\\npublicly available data. Our strong empirical results and extensive analysis\\ndemonstrate that LLMs can be effectively transformed into universal text\\nencoders in a parameter-efficient manner without the need for expensive\\nadaptation or synthetic GPT-4 generated data.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Video detailed captioning is a key task which aims to generate comprehensive\\nand coherent textual descriptions of video content, benefiting both video\\nunderstanding and generation. In this paper, we propose AuroraCap, a video\\ncaptioner based on a large multimodal model. We follow the simplest\\narchitecture design without additional parameters for temporal modeling. To\\naddress the overhead caused by lengthy video sequences, we implement the token\\nmerging strategy, reducing the number of input visual tokens. Surprisingly, we\\nfound that this strategy results in little performance loss. AuroraCap shows\\nsuperior performance on various video and image captioning benchmarks, for\\nexample, obtaining a CIDEr of 88.9 on Flickr30k, beating GPT-4V (55.3) and\\nGemini-1.5 Pro (82.2). However, existing video caption benchmarks only include\\nsimple descriptions, consisting of a few dozen words, which limits research in\\nthis field. Therefore, we develop VDC, a video detailed captioning benchmark\\nwith over one thousand carefully annotated structured captions. In addition, we\\npropose a new LLM-assisted metric VDCscore for bettering evaluation, which\\nadopts a divide-and-conquer strategy to transform long caption evaluation into\\nmultiple short question-answer pairs. With the help of human Elo ranking, our\\nexperiments show that this benchmark better correlates with human judgments of\\nvideo detailed captioning quality.</td>\n",
